# TypegraphQL + TypeORM Starter

Starter template for bootstrapping a TypeGraphQL + Apollo Server GraphQL API + TypeORM. The purpose is to help getting started quickly with TypeGraphQL + TypeORM development by providing a runnable API with examples you can build on.




## Installation

Install `typegraphql-typeorm-starter` with npm

    1. npm i typegraphql-typeorm-starter
    2. cd typegraphql-typeorm-starter
    3. npm install // in project root directory
    4. npm run watch // to start typescript watcher
    5. npm start // to start the server

## Note
   This stater uses typeORM to setup the configuration + connect to the database.

   ### Connecting to a database
   1. create a file called `ormconfig.json`.
   2. Dump this 
   ```js 
   {
      "type": "postgres",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 5432,
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "",
      "database": "databasename",
      "synchronize": true,
      "logging": false,
      "entities": [
        "dist/entities/**/*.js"
      ],
      "migrations": [
        "dist/migrations/**/*.js"
      ],
      "subscribers": [
        "dist/subscriber/**/*.js"
      ]
    } 
  ```
